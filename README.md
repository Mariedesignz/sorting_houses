# sorting_houses
This project is a random question quiz to see which Harry Potter Hopuse you will be sorted into.
I used Python as my langaufe of choice.
I created a function that adds one point for each answer. 
Meaning for each A 1 pt is added and at the end of the ten questions which ever answer has the post points you will be sorted into that House.
I created a constant to make my code DRY and not repeat the Phrase "Sorry I don't understand that answer." 
I used Import Random to ask the questions at Random.
In the future I want to add more questions and a sorting hat animation.
